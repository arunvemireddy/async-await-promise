# async-await-promise
'Promise', 'async' and 'await' are tools in JavaScript that help manage asynchronous code. They make it easier to work with operations that may take some time to complete, such as fetching data from a server, reading a file, oe performing other non-blocking tasks.

**Promises**: Provide a structed way to work with asynchrnous code, They allow you to handle the results or errors of an asynchrnous operation once it's completed.

**async/await**: Provide a more synchronous-looking way to work with asynchrnous code. They allow you to write code that looks similar to traditional synchrnous code, making it easier to read and reason about.

Using these features, you can create code that effectively handles asynchronous operations without blocking the main thread, which crucial for building responsive and efficient applications.
